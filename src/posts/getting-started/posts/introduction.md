We made this guide to help you get started contributing to our documentation.

## Eleventy

We are using Eleventy to generate our documentation. Eleventy is a static site generator that works with Markdown, HTML, and JavaScript. It's simple to use and easy to contribute to.

## Markdown

We use Markdown to write our documentation. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's easy to learn and easy to use.
